# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## A professional portfolio where employers can visit to view my work as a web developer.
Employers can also visit my portfolio webpage to gain a better understanding of who I am as a professional and to 
contact me should they so desire.


## User Story

```
AS A professional
I WANT to provide a potential employer with a deployed portfolio of work samples and contact information
SO THAT they can review samples of my work and assess whether they believe me to be a good candidate for an open position.
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
