        <h1 id="about-me">About Me:</h1>
            <p> Hello!</p>

            <p>I am Sarah Ramirez, a Mortgage Lending Professional with over 9 years
                expertise in the industry. I am currently employed as a Suspense Coordinator.
                Through dedication and commitment to excellence and integrity Iâ€™ve grown in the 
                industry of Retail and Wholesale National Operations. My fast learning, dependability,
                positive can-do attitude and ability to assess a problem and find a solution for said
                problem, have proven me to be a successful and valuable addition to my team.
            </p>   
            <p>I am seeking to take my knowledge and transition into the web development industry.
                I aspire to continue to cultivate my knowledge with a company that will
                be committed to match my passion and enthusiasm in the progression of
                my career as a webpage developer. I have proven to be successful in working as a remote
                professional and prefer to work remote, however, I always will be willing to
                consider other options as well.
            </p>
            <p> I look forward to a successful partnership with the right company! Thank you for your
                consideration and your time.
            </p>
